                    <p>Beacon Assistant is our realtime asset tracking solution built right into Turf Assistant. If Time Assistant, and our A.P.E.x performance monitoring isnâ€™t enough, beacons can be added to give realtime location tracking as well as historical playback of where all your equipment has been on the course. You can use this information to improve routing, equipment idle and transport times and an overall uptick in your labor performance.</p>
